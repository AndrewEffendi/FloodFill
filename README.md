# FloodFill
This program is used to connect similar pixels/depth by reading and outputing pgm (Portable Gray Map)
To use this program just open the Main.c and change the inputFile(line 31) to the pgm file you want to connect similar pixels and 
the outputFile(line 32) to the desire output file name

test.c is to test the functions. it reads input-1.pgm and input-2.pgm then outputs output-1.pgm and output-2.pgm respectively. and the expected output is expected-1.pgm and expected-2.pgm respectively.
imgUtils.c is where all the functions are stored.


note: you will need a pgm reader app such as GIMP to see the output file.
